# Urly - URL Shortener

Welcome to Urly, a simple yet powerful URL shortener.

## Demo
 - https://urly-515q.onrender.com/
 - (If it seems to not load, it is spinning up the server, just wait a little more)

## What does it do?

- You set up a URL to be shortened.
- The URL is stored in the database, and a redirect link is created.
- You receive the shortened link URL and an ID to track link data.
- The tracking data records every click, including user location, country, and platform.
- The tracking data can be visualized using the track ID, providing graphs to enhance your click insights.

## TODO:

- Buy a domain.
- Procure a cloud service to host the Flask app.

Until these TODOs are met, Urly cannot move forward.

## How to run:
